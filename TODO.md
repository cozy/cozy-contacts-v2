# TODO

Roadamp for cozy contacts. If you'd like to discuss or add an item, open an
issue.

## UX

- search on server side
- highlight search result
- lettered scroll for contact list (like on mobile)
- paginate History
- bulk tag management
- add tags & mentions to notes field
- make default page a list of tags / favorite / last contacted / last modified contacts

## Public route

- invite a contact to edit some of its information

## Analytics

- best way to contact X (mail, call, sms)
- best time to contact X (dont bother calling before 10am)
- best way to contact me
- best time to contact me (linked with obfuscated agenda)
- my contacts on a OpenStreetMap
- my activity by day / month / hours
- Tracker in kyou : sms & call received/sent
    - alert a friend if I stop using my phone

## Integration with other cozy apps

- tag a contact in photo
- add contacts birthdays in agenda
- invite a contact to an event
- make the notes on a contact an actual cozy-notes

## Integration with other cozys

- Share contact informations with an other Cozy

## Mobile

- Android : make the COZY app that export all logs + other data (geoloc, ...)
- iOS : I need help on this as I don't have a iPhone. If you feel like helping,
figure out a way to export iPhone call logs and sms into something readable (csv, json)
preferably free (as in beer) and that works with Win, Mac, Linux. Then open up an issue
with a few sample items from the exported file.
